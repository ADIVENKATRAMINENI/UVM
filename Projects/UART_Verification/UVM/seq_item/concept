UART Transaction Item — uart_txn

In UVM, a transaction (also called sequence item) represents a single piece of information that will be driven into the DUT.
For UART TX + RX verification, one transaction = one UART frame transfer.

The uart_txn class defines what information the driver receives from sequences and what the scoreboard/monitor expects to compare.

🧩 Code
class uart_txn extends uvm_sequence_item;
  rand bit [7:0] data;
  rand int unsigned idle_cycles; // delay before starting next byte

  constraint c_idle { idle_cycles inside {[0:10]}; }

  `uvm_object_utils(uart_txn)

  function new(string name="uart_txn");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction

  function string convert2string();
    return $sformatf("{data=0x%0h idle=%0d}", data, idle_cycles);
  endfunction
endclass

class uart_txn extends uvm_sequence_item;	           Defines a transaction object used by sequencer → driver	                            Sequence sends this txn to driver to stimulate DUT
rand bit [7:0] data;	                                           The byte to transmit (0–255)	                                                    UART transfers one byte per frame
rand int unsigned idle_cycles;	                          Number of idle cycles (no transmit) before next frame	                                   To test back-to-back vs spaced frames
constraint c_idle { idle_cycles inside {[0:10]}; }	             Legal constraint on idle cycles	                                         Prevents unrealistic delays (e.g., 1 million cycles)
`uvm_object_utils(uart_txn)	                                   Factory registration + automation helpers	                                        Required for creating via type_id::create()
function new(string name="uart_txn");	                                    Constructor	                                                            Used when manually creating the transaction
convert2string()	                                           Converts txn to printable format	                                              Very useful for debugging, logs, and scoreboard prints



Tip:

A UART transaction is intentionally byte-level and protocol-independent. It does not include start/stop bits because those are generated inside the DUT —
and that generation is what the testbench must verify.

So:
Data bits → provided by transaction
Start/stop/parity framing → verified by monitor and coverage
