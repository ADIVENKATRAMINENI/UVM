// uart_monitor:
// - Passive component that watches the UART interface.
// - Uses a virtual interface (uart_if.mon) to sample signals.
// - On TX side:
//     * When tx_start is asserted and tx_busy == 0,
//       it captures tx_data into uart_tx_s and sends it on ap_tx.
//     * This represents "a new frame has been accepted for transmit".
// - On RX side:
//     * When rx_valid is high, it captures rx_data into uart_rx_s
//       and sends it on ap_rx.
//     * This represents "a full byte has been received by RX".
// - The scoreboard subscribes to ap_tx (expected stream) and ap_rx
//   (actual stream), and compares transmitted vs received bytes.
// - This way, we verify end-to-end UART TX+RX loopback behavior
//   at the byte level without manually decoding serial waveforms.
