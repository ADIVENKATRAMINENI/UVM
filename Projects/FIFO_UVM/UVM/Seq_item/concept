Purpose:
//   Represents ONE operation for the driver to perform on the FIFO.
//   Each transaction carries the intent: write, read, or both,
//   along with the data value for write operations.
//
// Think of it like: "a single instruction" sent from Sequence → Driver.
// In UVM, all transactions extend `uvm_sequence_item` so they can be randomized, printed, compared, and sent via sequencer-driver handshakes.
