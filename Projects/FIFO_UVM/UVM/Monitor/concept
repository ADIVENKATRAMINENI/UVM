// 📘  Monitor Concepts Summary
//======================================================================
/*
  🧠 Role:
  --------
  - The monitor is a passive observer of the DUT’s behavior.
  - It samples interface signals at every clock edge and translates
    low-level pin activity into high-level transactions (write/read).

  📡 Analysis Ports:
  ------------------
  - uvm_analysis_port is a built-in UVM class for one-way broadcast.
  - When monitor calls ap_write.write(w), all connected subscribers
    (like scoreboard or coverage) automatically receive that transaction.
  - Multiple subscribers can connect to the same port — no duplication needed.

  🧩 Why use conditions:
  ----------------------
  - The monitor’s "if" conditions act as *filters*.
  - It records only *successful operations* for functional checking.
  - Failed or illegal attempts (like write when full, read when empty)
    can be logged or covered separately, but not sent to scoreboard.

  🧮 What monitor actually sends:
  ------------------------------
  - It doesn’t re-drive or re-simulate DUT behavior.
  - It simply *captures* DUT’s inputs/outputs and sends copies
    (fifo_write_s / fifo_read_s structs) for comparison or coverage.

  🔄 Timing:
  ----------
  - The monitor samples at posedge of clk, same as DUT internal logic.
  - This ensures transactions reflect actual DUT behavior in that cycle.

  🧭 Typical Connections:
  -----------------------
  In the environment, we connect:
      agent.monitor.ap_write.connect(scoreboard.write_export);
      agent.monitor.ap_read.connect(scoreboard.read_export);
  → This automatically triggers scoreboard.write() whenever
    monitor calls ap_write.write(w).

  💡 Advanced Tip:
  ----------------
  - To make the monitor smarter, you can add assertions inside it
    to flag illegal protocol cases like:
        assert (!(vif.wr_en && vif.full && !vif.rd_en));
        assert (!(vif.rd_en && vif.empty));
    These make it a lightweight protocol checker too.

  ✅ Summary:
  -----------
  - Passive observer, not a driver.
  - Converts pin activity → transaction events.
  - Broadcasts events to subscribers via analysis ports.
  - Filters only valid FIFO actions for scoreboard.
  - Logs invalid ones for debug or coverage.
